# NetflixClone
A responsive front-end clone of the Netflix landing page, built with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. This project focuses on recreating the visual layout and user interface of Netflix's home page, including sections like the navigation bar, hero banner, trending shows carousel, and FAQ accordion.
